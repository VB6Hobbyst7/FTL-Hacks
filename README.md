# FTL Scrap Hack

## About

![The trainer in action](https://github.com/danjaaron/FTL-Hacks/blob/master/ftl-scrap-trainer.PNG)

This repository contains the source code for an Infinite Scrap cheat for Faster-Than-Light (FTL).

Scrap is in the in-game currency for FTL. 

I was motivated to make this hack because I always wanted to play around with the cool advanced weapons in FTL, but never had enough scrap. Now it's easy!

## Setup

There are two options, depending on your system architecture.

### Option 1: Windows x86

If you're running Windows x86, simply run the standalone .EXE file after starting the game.

### Option 2: Cheat Engine

Open the attached Cheat Table (.CT) in Cheat Engine. Run the game and attach to the game process with Cheat Engine. 

Navigate to "Table" --> "Show Lua Script" and then click on "Execute Script". The trainer GUI shown above should open and the trainer will then activate. 

## Usage

Simply check the box to activate infinite scrap!
